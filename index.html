<!--h1>History of Computing Project 2</h1-->
<p>  The idea of this project was to create a simple game in VR that people 
could play using a Google Cardboard. It uses Unity and Google GVR SDK to create a 
VR environment for players to use. The game can be built for Android and can be played
on any Android phone that supports VR technology. </p>

<p>The project utilizes Unity and Google's VR SDK. It creates a 3D environment through
the use of GVR in Unity. It also uses Android's KitKat API so that it can be built 
correctly to the device for play. To create the scene, I used different planes and applied
textures to them to give them. The entire scene is lit by a point light. The player can 
turn around and look at different objects in the scene. If they are over an interactable 
object, then the reticle at the center of the screen will expand to show the player that
they can click on the object. On one wall is the object they're supposed to look for,
and when they select the right object the word displayed will change to the next object, 
which is chosen at random.</p>

<p>I was able to make a simple game in VR. I learned a lot about the GVR SDK and how Unity
doesn't always play nice with other programs. A lot of problems stemmed form Unity and GVR
just trying to talk to each other properly without expanding some sort of error into the 
scene at any given time. Even now, I still have some warnings that I don't understand. I 
cannot figure out where they're stemming from nor can I figure out how I'm supposed to
actually fix them most of the time.</p>
